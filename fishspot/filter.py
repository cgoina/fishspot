def maximum_deviation_threshold(image, mask=None, winsorize=(1, 99), sigma=8., recurse=False, max_steps=1000):
    """
    Select a threshold for a unimodal histogram with the maximum deviation method.
    This method draws a straight line from the peak/mode of the histogram to the
    tail and then finds the point on the histogram between the peak and tail which
    is maximally distant from this straight line.

    Here the unimodal assumption is relaxed in two ways: the input histogram is
    smoothed to remove high frequency noise and the peak is chosen to be the
    rightmost mode of the histogram. That is the histogram may have more than one
    mode, but it is assumed that there is a gradually decreasing tail to the right
    of the final mode.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : nd-array
        The data which we want to threshold

    mask : nd-array (default: None)
        A binary mask of image. Only voxels in the foreground will be considered.

    winsorize : length 2 tuple (default: (1, 99))
        The lower and upper percentiles to cut off from the histogram. This adds
        robustness to outliers.

    sigma : float (default: 8.)
        The standard deviation of the gaussian applied to the histogram to smooth
        high frequency components (extra modes/bumps due to noise).

    recurse : bool (default: False)
        If True this function is called recursively to guarantee that the tail to
        the right of the found point monotonically decreases. This can cause very
        long run times and is very sensitive to noise.

    max_steps : int (default: 1000)
        Safety cap on the number of get_line/get_point iterations. Each iteration
        shrinks the working histogram by at least one bin, so convergence within
        len(histogram) steps is guaranteed; this cap just bounds the worst-case
        run time for very large or pathological histograms. If the cap is hit,
        -1 is returned instead of a threshold.

    Returns
    -------
        threshold : float
            The maximum deviation threshold for the rightmost mode to tail of the
            image histogram. -1 if no threshold could be determined.
